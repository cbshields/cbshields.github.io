Well, here I am at my first “real” project! Before I get into the details...For those who are about to start this project, I need you to do one thing…BREATHE! It may seem like a lot of steps to do, but if you do it one step at a time, I promise you’ll get through it.

 

When I first read the requirements, I’m thinking to myself… ugh, what is all this stuff, this is going to be so annoying. I even mentioned it to my mom how this was going to be a lot of work. She of course was no help. She has 4 masters and Lord knows what other letters behind her name, and she basically told me to suck it up lol.

 

IT IS NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS! I rolled my eyes as I started to watch the DAILY DEAL walk through video. But as I was watching it, I started to get excited because now I could write actual code for a real situation. First hurdle to get over - how do you pick a website? Pick something you love doing. Mine is cooking/trying out new recipes.  I searched around the web, found a web site and then looked at how they built it to make sure scraping the info I needed would not be too difficult.

 

Now that I had my website, I watched the daily deal video again so I could work alongside with what was being done in the video.  Not everything fit perfectly, but I was able to get all the pseudo-code working before I started scraping my website.

 

Scraping the website was the easiest part of this project. I ran into a little trouble with getting the directions grouped together, but Slack came to the rescue and someone was able to help me with my code.

 

My final hurdle was trying to figure out how to get my program to completely exit when someone typed exit.  My project had a couple nested while loops (list the food categories, then listed the recipes under the food category, then the actual recipe) so it took some figuring out. I ended up writing "hacky" code to get it to work, but hey, sometimes it's needed to get the job done, right?

But all in all, it was a good learning experience and I am looking forward to the next project.
