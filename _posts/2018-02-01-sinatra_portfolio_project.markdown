This was WAY easier to code than the CLI project, mainly due to:

1) I know what I'm doing...sort of
2) We did a "test run" of the final project in the Fwitter lab
3) Kept it easy

I have an inate ability to make the lab/project more complicated than it needs to be. This time, I decided to join a study group BEFORE I actually started the project. I found out that this project could be used as a foundation for the Rails project, so it made sense to not make this one complicated.

Now I'm not saying I ran into any issues, but doing the Fwitter lab defintely helped with coding my final project. Most of my mistakes in Fwitter were syntax errors: missing ">", leaving the "=" sign out in front of the variable, small things that can make someone loose their mind because the tests aren't passing. When working in this project, I was very careful and made sure I wasn't going to make the same mistakes. Most of my mistakes were having the wrong syntax for the passing the params, but it was easily fixable.

I have to say I enjoyed coding this project and looking forward to the next one!
