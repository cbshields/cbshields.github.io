This was a very frustrating project for me. If I had used one of the examples or used my Sinatra portfolio project; it would have saved me at least two months of troubleshooting/1:1s with the technical coaches. Also, try to stick with one technical coach. By the time I was finished explaining my issue, half the time would be gone. My issue wouldn't get resolved so as I signed up for another session, it would be a different person, and I would have to start all over again. Make sure to ask what their times are so if you can schedule during that time, you don't need to spend as much time explaining the issue. For the smaller issues, it's fine to get different technical coaches, but for the more complex issues, try to schedule the same person.

The most difficult part of this project was trying to get the objects associated correctly with each other in the forms. Since my position objects were dependent on the sport object, I couldn't create the basic nested form. But once I had that figured out, the rest somewhat fell into place.
