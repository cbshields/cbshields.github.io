So, picture this...Tempe, AZ April 2017: my company had decided to lay off everyone who had worked there 10 years or longer. I was one of the few ones that survived. As I'm seeing my friends/co-workers leave, I realized that I got lucky and next time, this could happen to me. Even though I had worked in IT for over 20 years as an messaging systems/Cloud groupware engineer; my skill set was so specialized that I couldn't just pick up and get another job somewhere.

Lo and behold, I happened to receive an email from Birchbox stating that they were "celebrating women in web development" by offering partial scolarships to FlatIron's Web Development program. I submitted my application, had my interview and I was one of the ones who received a scholarship! I couldn't believe it! Now I felt better about my future. I would finish this program, continue to work at my company as a web developer for a couple years then leave for another job. Well...that was the idea anyway...

About a year ago, my friend was talking about working for his company - working with a proprietary software that did investigative/compliance searching. Well, I did this as part of my job as an messaging admin with eDiscovery, but didn't know there was a whole industry dedicated to this. So I talked to my prospective employers and they were excited to have me on the team. So, after 23+ years of working at my only job out of college, I left for a new job.

The sad part about this is that I will not be doing any web development. But I still wanted to see this through and have a better understanding of what programmers do today.
