At first when I sat down to start coding, to say I was overwhelmed was an understatement. I mean, I couldn't even get the javascript to load. If this was going to be any indication on what the rest of my project was going to be like, I wanted no parts of it. Which I think caused most of my delays in starting this. But I finally stopped procrastinating and thank goodness I went to the Office hours for JS Rails. Brad helped me get my javascript working and worked with me to get my js project code actually started. These videos also helped me alot:

Most of my time was spent trying to figure out how the code worked (ie: use .map instead of forEach). I was also getting too focused on all the associations instead of just doing the requirements. One of the consistent things about my journey becoming a programmer - I make the projects/code more complex than it needs to be.

As I pushed through this project, there were times that I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. So I would stop and work on something else. It gets your mind focused elsewhere and gives you a break from worrying about the other code. Or I would just stop altogether and start back up the next day. The point is that it's best you keep going, no matter how "down the rabbit hole" you get.

But overall, I have to say for as long as this project took to get completed, it was actually easy once I understood what I was doing.
