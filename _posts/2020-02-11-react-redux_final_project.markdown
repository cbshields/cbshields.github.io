As the addage goes: "If I only knew then what I know now...," I would have not put off doing my final project for so long. I was at first DREADING even starting this project because of all the problems/frustrations I had with the other projects. But I finally sat myself down and told myself that you were going to get this finished. And I have to say, it was probably one of the easier projects I had done. I kept it very simple and watched the React/Redux final project videos and was able to get it done in two weeks. If I were to do this all over again, I think I would separate my front-end and my back-end into 2 separate projects. When you set it up as one big project, the rails and npm server can get hung up so I had to start/stop the server alot. I think if I had each on it's own server, I wouldn't have run into that problem as much.

So here is my advice to you:

1. Just start it already. It is not as bad as you think

2. Definitely watch the videos: https://instruction.learn.co/student/video_lectures#/?query=expense You can code-along as the video is being played

3. You may run into config issues/problems, but take your time and research the problem. More often than not, you will find the solution.
